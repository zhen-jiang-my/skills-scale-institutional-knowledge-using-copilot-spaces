## Step 3: Create an issue and pull request to improve project management processes

In this step, you will practice iterative process improvement by:

1. Creating a GitHub issue using an issue template to document needed improvements to personas/roles in project management processes
2. Using GitHub Copilot's Copilot Cloud Agent to automatically create a pull request that implements these improvements

This demonstrates a complete improvement workflow: identify gaps (issue) → implement solutions (pull request) → maintain traceability (linked in Copilot Space).

### 📖 Theory: Iterative Process Improvement

Effective process evolution follows a lightweight cycle:

- Review current documentation and execution reality
- Identify gaps, ambiguities, or missing personas/roles
- Record the need as a structured issue (problem statement + rationale)
- Design and implement improvements (docs, templates, checklists) in a PR
- Communicate changes via clear descriptions and linked artifacts
- Measure adoption and revisit as new insights emerge

  > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)
  >
  > ```prompt
  > Use the attached issue template
  > - Identify potential new personas/roles that could be added to the project management processes documentation
  >   to enhance clarity and accountability.
  > - Create an issue titled "Adding more personas and roles to the project management processes"
  >    that outlines the need to expand the defined roles and responsibilities in the project management documentation.
  > - Make sure the new roles/personas have descriptions of their responsibilities and how they interact with existing roles.
  > - The issue should detail why this is important, potential personas to add, and how it will improve project outcomes.
  > - Identify `docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` in the issue as the process document to update in future work.
  > - Only create the issue. Do not modify files, create a branch, commit changes, or create a pull request.

### ⌨️ Activity: Attach an issue and create a Pull Request

_Use the following prompt in the current Copilot Space conversation:_

In the same Copilot Space conversation do the following:

1. In this activity we will attach the issue you created in the previous activity
2. This will assign the issue to the Copilot Cloud Agent to create a pull request with an update to our personas/roles document in the `docs/` folder
3. Copy and paste the URL for the issue that we created in the previous activity.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the issue below matches the issue you want to attach
> Hit **\<SHIFT\> + \<ENTER\>** so you don't start Copilot working on the conversation

   In case the issue is not attached properly, you can also type the issue reference in the conversation:

   Check issues list: [https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues](https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues)

   ```text
   @{{full_repo_name}}/issues/#
   ```

   (Example: if your issue is #4, type `@{{full_repo_name}}/issues/4`)

   <img width="40%" alt="Prompt to create a pull request from the attached personas and roles issue in Copilot Space" src="../images/repository-issue-pr-creation-step3.png" />

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)
   >
   > ```prompt
   > - Verify the attached issue is titled "Adding more personas and roles to the project management processes".
   > - If a different issue is attached, stop and do not create a pull request.
   > - Create a pull request that implements the attached issue.
   > - Update `docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` with the proposed personas and roles.
   > - Describe each new persona's responsibilities and how they interact with existing roles.
   > - Keep the changes focused on the attached issue and this document.
   > - In the pull request description, add `Closes #<issue-number>`, replacing `<issue-number>` with the attached issue's number.
   > - Add {{login}} as a reviewer for this pull request
